# Valorant-Survey
The Valorant Survey is a Python program that allows users to answer a few questions about their Valorant habits and receive a visualization of their results. The survey asks the user how many hours per week and per day they spend playing Valorant, as well as their favorite game mode.

After the user submits their responses, the program calculates the total number of hours spent playing Valorant and displays a pie chart showing the breakdown of hours spent playing Valorant versus other games. The pie chart is created using the Matplotlib library and includes a title indicating the user's favorite game mode.
